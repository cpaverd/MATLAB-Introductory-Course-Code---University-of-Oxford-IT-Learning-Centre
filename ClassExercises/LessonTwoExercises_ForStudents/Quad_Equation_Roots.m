% Exercise 8 - Quadratic Equation


%The roots of a quadratic equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 depend on
%the discriminant, D, which is defined as D = b^2 - 4ac.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%Define a, b, and c with random values






%Calculate D






%Use if and if else statements to determine the type of roots for
%the equation. It is helpful to print a message to show the outcome
%of the if statements






%Repeat the if statement, and use the general form of the quadratic
%equation to calculate the roots is they exist
