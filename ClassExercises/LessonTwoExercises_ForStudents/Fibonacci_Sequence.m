%Fionacci Sequence Script

%The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5. In
%order to calculate the next number, you need to apply the formula:
%       Next Fibonacci Number = Sum of the Previous two Fibonacci Numbers
%       i.e. F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%Step 1
%Create a matrix to store the values zero and one, in that order





%Step 2 and 3
%Create a for loop to calculate the first 20 numbers of the Fibonacci
%sequence using the formula provided above
%Take care to define the start and end values of the loop conidition
%correctly
%In step 3: create the sumFib variable and add it before the loop

for index = %Complete this condition

    %Calculate the next Fibonacci number using the formula provided
    
end




%Step 4: display the output message here using num2str function and either
%the disp or strcat functions.
